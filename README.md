$HiDF$ is a high-quality, **human-indistinguishable deepfake dataset** comprising 30K images and 4K videos, curated to include diverse subjects and undergo rigorous quality checks. It addresses the limitations of existing datasets by providing more realistic and undetectable deepfakes. This makes HiDF an invaluable benchmark for advancing deepfake detection research, with data and code publicly available for future studies.



# ðŸ’¡ Data Description

* \# of real image: 30,250
